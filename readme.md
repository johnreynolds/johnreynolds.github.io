# Decision Coach
Decision coaches help people and groups make important decisions by asking questions and offering advice.

# [Questions](questions.md)
Asking the right questions at the right time can help move clients towards reaching a decision.  

# [Criteria](criteria.md)
Every decision should satisfy a set of requirements. 
This set of requirements is also know as criteria, and when multiple options are being considered the degree to which each option satisfies the criteria should be of primary importance when choosing one over another.

Helping the client to flesh out the criteria for making their decision is of primary importance.
