DecisionCoach is an attempt to automate that coaching process.

Decisions should satisfy a set of requirements. This set of requirements is also know as criteria, and when multiple options are being considered the degree to which each option satisfies the criteria should be of primary importance when choosing one over another.

Decision Coaches ask a lot of questions to help others reach decisions. The sequence in which these questions are asked is highly variable and based on the decision coach's instinct on which question will most quickly lead to reaching an informed decision.

Some questions are designed to probe deeper. Other questions are designed to shift attention.
