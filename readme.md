# Decision Coaching
Decision coaches help people and groups make important decisions.

The primary skill of a decision coach is to be able to ask questions that move the client towards reaching a decision. At each step of the decision making process, the coach asks the questions that will most quickly lead to the decision.Decision coaches help people make decisions by asking questions and offering advice.

DecisionCoach is an attempt to automate that coaching process.

# Criteria
Decisions should satisfy a set of requirements. This set of requirements is also know as criteria, and when multiple options are being considered the degree to which each option satisfies the criteria should be of primary importance when choosing one over another.

# Questions
Decision Coaches ask a lot of questions to help others reach decisions. The sequence in which these questions are asked is highly variable and based on the decision coach's instinct on which question will most quickly lead to reaching an informed decision.

When coaching folks towards reaching a decision, the advice that you give and the questions that you ask should be influenced by how far along the process is. Some questions are designed to probe deeper. Other questions are designed to shift attention.

How much do they know, and how much do they still need to know?

Are they making progress, or are they stuck?

If they are stuck, what do you think is their problem?

Are they unable to find important information?

Are they unable to resolve priorities?
